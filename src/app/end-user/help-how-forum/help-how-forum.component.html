          You can use facebook in conjunction with Galilee to communicate with
          your small group.  To do this, have your small group leader set up
          a facebook group and invite the other members to the group.
          Then, if you click on a facebook icon on Galilee, you will be able to post
          comments to your small group or friends on facebook.  Your post
          will contain a link back to the Galilee page that you were on.

          Welcome to the Forum feature of Galilee.
          Research tells us that one of the most powerful means of growing spiritually is to communicate with others about Scripture.
          The Forum feature is a tool to communicate with others through Galilee.
          Your group might consist of a small group Bible study, a friend or two, a family or a mentor and mentee – whomever you'd like.
          On the Forum you can share prayer requests, your reflections from the readings, questions, encouragement, links to other websites – whatever you'd like.
          Whatever you write within the Forum is only visible to the people you have added to your Forum group.
